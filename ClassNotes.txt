Fixed Point Iteration

	
f(x,y) = 0 : implicit (function more work)   x^2+y^2 = r^2
y = f(x) : explicit   y = mx+b

semi-explicit
	functions that we can make look like x = f(x)  =>  x - f(x) = 0 : implicit form of semi-explicit equation


fixed point iteration uses semi-explicit form only

for the moody diagram

x = 1/sqrt(f)

x = -2log[(E/D)/3.7+2.51/Re*x] = g(x)

Step 1: guess x0
	eval: x1 = g(x0)
	check:
		the realative change:   x1-x0 < tolerance  (cheap and easy way to check) realative step error/change
		rearrange into implicit form:   |x1-g(x1)| < tolerance :  (computationally heavy) abs. residual error : with carefull staggering of steps you can compute this every time without additional work
Step 2: x2 = g(x1)
	eval
	check again
Repeat untill convergance
